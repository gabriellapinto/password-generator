# password-generator

## About This Project:
The objective for this project was to use the given code and create a functional password generator. We had to create a function called generatePassword() and use for loops, webAPI's, and other JavaScript elements to create a complete random password. This password must meet all requirements that the user allowed by clicking on the corresponding boolean prompts.
